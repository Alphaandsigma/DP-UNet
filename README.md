Computed tomography (CT) is crucial in rapidly and accurately segmenting the extent of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung infections, with great potential to aid the development of patient recovery plans. However, the considerable similarity between COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia, coupled with the intricacies of CT imaging, poses significant challenges in accurately segmenting the infected regions. This study proposes a novel medical image model for COVID-19 lung infection segmentation in response to these challenges. The model architecture includes dual branch attention multi-layer encoder modules, the lateral branch comprises an enhanced parallel concurrent spatial and channel squeeze and channel excitation module, designed for recalibrating channel attention. Dual branch attention encoder modules exploit contextual information from the input lung infection images through dual-branch extraction operations. At the encoder-decoder interface, a progressive fused pyramid pooling module is employed that not only preserves the original input semantic information but also expands the model receptive field, thereby enhancing its ability to segment COVID-19 lesion boundaries accurately, it promotes the integration of diverse scale semantic details within the lung infection regions by the model. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms all other comparative models regarding the DSC values of 0.8459. Through a quantitative analysis of the experimental evaluation metrics and a visual comparison of the segmentation results of COVID-19-infected regions, it has been demonstrated that the proposed model exhibits a higher level of robustness. It is capable of effectively segmenting COVID-19-infected regions.
